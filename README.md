## üöÄ How to Use Native Motion Components

Native Motion is designed to be incredibly straightforward for developers:

1.  **Browse the Documentation:** Visit our official documentation site at [nativemotion.dev](https://nativemotion.dev) Here you can explore:
    *   Live previews of each component.
    *   Detailed usage instructions and code snippets.
    *   Information on available props for customization.
    *   Any necessary installation prerequisites (e.g., peer dependencies like `react-native-reanimated`).
2.  **Select a Component:** Identify the component that fits your needs.
3.  **Copy the Code:** Each component's documentation page will provide the relevant code snippet.
4.  **Paste into Your Project:** Integrate the copied code into your React Native application's codebase.
5.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure any peer dependencies mentioned in the component's documentation (like `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`) are installed in your project.
6.  **Customize:** Adapt the component using its props to match your application's theme and requirements.

The documentation site is the primary resource for understanding how to utilize each component effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

While the components are for **React Native**, the Native Motion documentation site itself is built with:

*   **Next.js:** For a fast and modern documentation experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the documentation.
*   **MDX:** For rich and interactive component documentation.
*   **TypeScript:** For robust and maintainable code.

Our React Native components are primarily built using:

*   **React Native**
*   **React Native Reanimated 3**
*   **React Native Gesture Handler**
*   Designed with compatibility for both **Expo** and standard React Native CLI projects in mind.
